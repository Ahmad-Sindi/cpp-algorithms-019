# Algorithm Challenge #19 – Circle Area Through Diameter

## 🧮 Problem Description
This challenge focuses on calculating the **area of a circle** when the **diameter** is given.  
Instead of using the radius, the formula adapts to work directly with the full diameter.

---

## 🧠 Formula
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{\pi \times d^2}{4}
\]

---

## 💡 What You’ll Learn
- How to use constants (`const`) in C++  
- How to apply mathematical formulas correctly  
- The importance of parentheses in arithmetic expressions  
- How to use the `pow()` function from `<cmath>`

---

## 🧩 Example
**Input:**  
Enter the diameter of the circle: 10

**Output:**  
The area of the circle is: 78.5398

---

## 📂 File Information
- **Language:** C++  
- **File Name:** `circle_area_diameter.cpp`  
- **Challenge Number:** #19  

---

## 💬 Notes
This challenge demonstrates the relationship between radius and diameter in calculating a circle’s area — a great example of applying math logic in programming.
